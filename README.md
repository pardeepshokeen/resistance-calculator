 <h3> How to use online resistance calculator </h3>
  <p> The Resistance Calculator finds the equivalent resistance between
   point "A" and "B". Hence, draw your circuit between A and B.</p>
   <h4> Steps to draw circuit </h4>
  <ol >
  <li> Select a point(blue dots). Doing this will hide the selected dot. </li>
  <li> Now select the other dot between which you want to place the resistance.</li>
     This will display the resistance box 
  <li> Select resistance from resistance box (from 1-9) </li>
  <li> Great. You have added a resistance. Now complete the circuit between A and B </li>
  <li> Click Calculate to calculate the equivalent resistance </li>
  <li> Clicking on RESET will reset the whole circuit </li>

  </ol>
